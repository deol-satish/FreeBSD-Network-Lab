Advanced congestion control in FreeBSD
FreeBSD supports TCP autotuning and advanced congestion control algorithms in all currently-supported releases. You can check which are available in the running kernel using:

  sysctl net.inet.tcp.cc.available
To make additional algorithms available in the kernel, the appropriate module must be loaded. The congestion control modules are in /boot/kernel and begin with cc_ - they can be listed with the following command:

  ls /boot/kernel/cc_* | grep -v symbols
To load a particular congestion control algorithm (for example dctcp) you can use:

  kldload cc_dctcp
and you will then be able to set the congestion control algorithm using this:

  sysctl net.inet.tcp.cc.algorithm=dctcp


sysctl net.inet.tcp.cc.available
ls /boot/kernel/cc_* | grep -v symbols
kldload cc_dctcp
sysctl net.inet.tcp.cc.algorithm=dctcp

sysctl -a | grep dctcp

sysctl net.inet.tcp.cc.dctcp.ect1=1

TO enable DCTCP at boot time:
Depending how your kernel is built, you may not have the algorithm you want available by default at boot time, 
and will need to load the driver during the boot process. To to this add the following to /boot/loader.conf:

cc_dtcp_load="YES"
