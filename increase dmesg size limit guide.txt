It looks like your `messages` log file was rotated because it exceeded 1000 KB in size. 
This is a normal part of log management; the `newsyslog` utility handles rotating 
and compressing log files to prevent them from getting too large.

If you want to keep an eye on log sizes or adjust the rotation settings, 
you might want to check the configuration files for `newsyslog`, which are typically found in `/etc/newsyslog.conf`. 
You can adjust settings such as file size limits, rotation frequency, and how many old log files to keep.
